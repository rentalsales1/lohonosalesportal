                        <li>15 days before the check-in date, the complete difference would be refunded.</li>
                        <li>7 -14 days before the check-in date, the amount of one villa night will be forfeited.</li>

                <li>A rescheduling request cannot be raised during peak dates or blackout dates.</li>

No refunds will be made for any price change including rate fluctuations that would otherwise alter the rental cost. IVPL reserves the right to impose any taxes or other charges which may be implemented by any government or other regulatory body, which were unknown at the time of publishing.

            <p>Check-in and check-out time shall be as specified in relevant Booking Confirmation and shall be strictly adhered to. IVPL recommends and encourages Guests not to arrive at Property before stated Check-In time.

            <p>The Guests shall be responsible to check and report any damage to the Property or its equipment, appliances, cutlery, crockery, utensils, furniture, fittings, furnishing, finishing, structure, etc. there in within 30 minutes of Check-In. If the Guest fails to report any of the damages after such specified time period, such damage shall be deemed to have occurred during stay of the Guests and the Guests shall be held responsible for such damages and resulting charges thereof. Guests shall be responsible to reimburse IVPL for any such damage / breakage caused by the Guests to the Property or any of things attached to it such as equipment, appliances, cutlery, crockery, utensils, furniture, fittings, furnishing, finishing, structure, etc. during their stay without demure.</p>
            <p>Guests shall use the Property, including its equipment, appliances, cutlery, crockery, utensils, furniture, fittings etc. therein with utmost care and without causing any intentional, unintentional or accidental damage to them.

The Guests understand and agree that IVPL cannot immediately inspect the Property promptly at the check-out time of the Guests. The inspection for damages shall be done by IVPL in the intervening time between Guest’s Check-Out and next Check-In. Thus, refunding of Security Deposit after adjusting any recoverable, if any, cannot be done immediately on Check-Out. IVPL shall make an effort to refund the balance Security Deposit as soon as possible, subject to maximum of 4 working days from date of check-out. After the inspection, the assessed cost of repairs / replacement shall be communicated to Guests for their information. The assessment cost of repairs / replacement arrived at by IVPL shall be final and binding on the Guests and the Guests shall have no say in the matter and IVPL shall have no obligation to take any prior approval from the Guests for its assessment of repair/ replacement to be done.</p>
            <p>If the amount of repair/ replacement of equipment, appliances, furniture, fittings, furnishing, finishing and artifacts etc. exceeds the amount of Security Deposit, the excess amount shall be notified to the Guests, and the Guests shall be liable to pay the same, without demure, within 7 (seven) days of such demand being raised by IVPL. Any refund due against Security Deposit shall be made through a cheque or bank transfer in favour of the Guests as per the account details provided by the Guests. The Guests understand and agree that they shall leave and check out from the Property in a reasonably clean state and make sure that appliances & equipment e.g. air conditioning, heater, lights, fans etc. are turned off and furniture returned to their original locations. Failure to comply with the above shall result in extra cleaning charges plus applicable taxes.</p>
